# Crypto Tax Calculator (Australia)

A React-based web application designed to help Australian users calculate their cryptocurrency taxes. This tool estimates capital gains tax and net tax liability based on user inputs such as annual income, purchase price, sale price, and expenses.

## Overview of the Task

- Allow users to input financial details (purchase price, sale price, expenses, and annual income).
- Calculate capital gains tax based on Australian tax brackets.
- Support both short-term and long-term investment types.
- Display the applicable tax rate and estimated tax liability.
